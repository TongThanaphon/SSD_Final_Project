<strong>Obbserver</strong> The User class extend Observable and UserInfoGUI implements Observer, it will notify to GUI when the user has do someting about money in the account (deposit, withdraw and transfer). </br>
<strong>Singleton</strong> Define the DbManager class as the class that use singleton pattern to protect calling mulitple time for store data.</br>
<strong>Stategy</strong> Deposit, Withdraw and Transfer class create all of this class as interface and it has method that do about each activity. It is easy when you want to add more curreny for exchange to this app.</br>
